# Mutters fastText intent
This is an IntentMatcher implementation that uses Facebook's fastText document classifier.

It uses the [JFastText](https://github.com/vinhkhuc/JFastText) library which binds to the C++ based fastText implementation. As such it requires native libraries. JFastText provides native libaries for Windows, Mac and Linux.
